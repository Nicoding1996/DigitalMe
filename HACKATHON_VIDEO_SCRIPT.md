**Shot 3 (0:10-0:20): Live Interaction**
- **Type this on the left side:** "What's the best way to announce a new product launch?"
- Press Enter
- Watch AI response appear on the right side
- Let it type out naturally (streaming effect)
- Show the mirror/reflection concept visually

**On-screen text:** 
- "DigitalMe: Your AI Reflection" (appears at 0:10, center of screen)

**Voiceover:**
"What if your AI didn't just answer questions... but became you? Meet DigitalMe - your digital doppelgänger that learns your writing style, mirrors your personality, and evolves with every conversation."

### Filming Tips:
- Start recording with a black screen (cover your camera or use black image)
- The "glitch effect" is added in post-production using video editing software

### Scene 8: Full Workflow
**Main prompt:** "Write a product announcement for DigitalMe"
**Refinement:** "make it shorter"

### Text Sample to Paste (Scene 3 - Choose one style)

**Option A - Casual Chat:**
```
hey! so i've been thinking about this project idea. basically it's like having an AI that actually sounds like you, not some generic robot. i'm tired of AI responses that are so obviously fake, you know? like when you read something and immediately think "yeah, that was chatgpt." 

the cool part is it learns from your actual writing - emails, github commits, blog posts, whatever. then when you ask it to write something, it comes out in YOUR voice. your tone, your vocabulary, your style. it's like having a clone that can write for you.

i think this could be huge for content creators who need to scale their output but don't want to lose their authentic voice. or developers who want their documentation to sound consistent. or anyone who uses AI but wants it to be less obvious.

what do you think? worth building?
```

**Option B - Professional Email:**
```
Hi team,

I wanted to share some thoughts on our content strategy moving forward. We've been using AI tools to help with drafting, but I've noticed the output often lacks our brand voice. The responses tend to be generic and corporate, which doesn't align with our more conversational approach.

I'm proposing we explore solutions that can learn and replicate our specific writing style. This would allow us to maintain consistency across all our communications while still benefiting from AI assistance. The key is finding a balance between efficiency and authenticity.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Are there any tools you've found that do this well? Or should we consider building something custom?

Looking forward to the discussion.

Best regards
```

**Option C - Technical Documentation:**
```
# Implementation Notes

After reviewing the authentication flow, I've identified several areas for improvement. The current OAuth implementation works, but there are edge cases we need to handle better.

First, the token refresh logic needs to be more robust. Right now, if a refresh fails, we don't have a good fallback strategy. We should implement exponential backoff and notify the user if we can't recover.

Second, the session management could be cleaner. We're storing too much state in localStorage, which makes debugging difficult. Consider moving to a more structured approach with proper state management.

Third, error handling needs work. We're catching errors but not always providing useful feedback to the user. Every error should have a clear message and recovery path.

These aren't critical issues, but addressing them would significantly improve the user experience and make the codebase more maintainable.
```

## TECHNICAL NOTES FOR VIDEO PRODUCTION

### Visual Style
- **Color Palette:** Use your Black Mirror theme (void-deep backgrounds, static-white text, accent colors)
- **Transitions:** Glitch effects between scenes
- **Typography:** System-style monospace fonts for code, clean sans-serif for UI
- **Pacing:** Quick cuts for energy, slow-mo for key UI moments

### Screen Recording Tips
1. **Clean browser window** - No bookmarks bar, extensions, or distractions
2. **Zoom in on key interactions** - OAuth flow, profile updates, refinement requests
3. **Use cursor highlights** - Make clicks obvious
4. **Prepare demo data** - Have test Gmail account, GitHub repos, blog URLs ready
5. **Record at 1080p minimum** - 4K if possible

### Audio
- **Professional voiceover** - Clear, confident, slightly mysterious tone (matches Black Mirror vibe)
- **Background music** - Subtle electronic/ambient (low volume, don't overpower voice)
- **Sound effects** - Glitch sounds for transitions, subtle UI sounds

### B-Roll Suggestions
- Code snippets from your project
- Kiro IDE interface with steering docs open
- Terminal showing npm commands
- File tree showing project structure
- GitHub commits timeline

## KIRO USAGE WRITE-UP (For Submission Form)

### How Kiro Was Used

**Steering Documents (3 files):**
Created comprehensive steering docs that acted as the project's "brain":
- `tech.md` - Defined React 19, TailwindCSS, Express stack with specific patterns
- `structure.md` - Mapped entire monorepo architecture and file conventions
- `product.md` - Detailed the Dynamic Persona Protocol and multi-source intelligence

**Impact:** Every code generation respected these rules. When I asked Kiro to "add a new data source," it automatically used the service-oriented architecture, proper error handling, and TailwindCSS styling defined in steering. This eliminated 90% of refactoring.

**Spec-Driven Development (8 specs):**
Broke down complex features into structured specs with requirements and tasks:
- `gmail-integration` - OAuth flow, email retrieval, cleansing service
- `multi-source-merging` - Quality-weighted algorithm, confidence calculation
- `living-profile` - Real-time learning, batch processing, delta reporting
- `advanced-style-analysis` - Pattern extraction, vocabulary analysis

**Impact:** Specs provided structure for complex features. The Gmail integration spec had 15 tasks - Kiro implemented the OAuth flow, rate limiting, error handling, and security measures systematically. Compared to vibe coding, specs reduced back-and-forth by 60% and caught edge cases early.

**Vibe Coding:**
Used conversational development for rapid iteration:
- "Add glitch effect to transitions" → Generated CSS animations with Black Mirror aesthetic
- "Implement blog scraper that handles Medium, Dev.to, and WordPress" → Built intelligent content extraction with cheerio
- "Fix the OAuth callback race condition" → Debugged and implemented proper token encryption

**Most impressive generation:** Asked Kiro to "create a quality-weighted merging algorithm that combines multiple data sources with different confidence levels." It generated a 200-line service class with proper normalization, spam detection, and source attribution - working on first try.

**Development Workflow:**
1. Steering docs set the foundation (architecture, patterns, style)
2. Specs structured complex features (requirements → tasks → implementation)
3. Vibe coding handled rapid iteration (bug fixes, UI polish, new ideas)

**Result:** Built a production-ready full-stack app with 50+ components, 4 external API integrations, OAuth security, and real-time AI learning in 3 weeks. Kiro handled ~85% of code generation, letting me focus on product vision and user experience.
